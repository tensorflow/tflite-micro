# Installlation
Our test scripts assume that the non static `user` mode installation of QEMU is
available in the PATH.  For example, if using QEMU for ARM testing, please make
sure `qemu-arm` is installed and available to the test scripts.

# Software Emulation with QEMU
TensorFlow Lite Micro makes use of [QEMU](https://qemu.org) to
for testing cross compiled tests.

QEMU can quickly test unit tests that are cross compiled for non x64\_86
hardware.

# Running Unit Tests
All unit tests can be ran using
`tensorflow/lite/micro/tools/ci_build/test_cortex_m_qemu.sh` for the cortex-m
processor.

# Useful External Links for QEMU
The current QEMU implementation uses `user` mode.  The documentation for [user
mode is here](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/user/index.html).

QEMU uses ARM
[semihosting](https://github.com/ARM-software/abi-aa/blob/main/semihosting/semihosting.rst)
to replace newlib system calls for specific boards with the host OS.  Further
documentation on how this works is contained in `cortex_m_qemu_makefile.inc`.
