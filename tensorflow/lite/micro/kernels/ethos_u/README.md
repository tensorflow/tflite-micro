# Info
Arm(R) Ethos(TM)-U is a new class of machine learning processors, called a
microNPU, specifically designed to accelerate ML inference in area-constrained
embedded and IoT devices. This readme briefly describes how to integrate Ethos-U
related hardware and software into TFLM. See also [Ethos-U ML Evaluation kit examples](https://gitlab.arm.com/artificial-intelligence/ethos-u/ml-embedded-evaluation-kit).

To enable the Ethos-U software stack, add `CO_PROCESSOR=ethos_u` to the make
command. Use ETHOSU_ARCH to specify the architecture. See examples below.

## Requirements:
- Armclang 6.14 or later
- GCC 10.2.1 or later

## Ethos-U custom operator
The TFLM runtime will dispatch workloads to Ethos-U when it encounters an
Ethos-U custom op in the tflite file. See an ASCII art example below.
The Ethos-U custom op is added by a tool called Ethos-U Vela and contains
information the Ethos-U hardware need to execute the workload. More info in the
[Vela repository](https://gitlab.arm.com/artificial-intelligence/ethos-u/ethos-u-vela).

```

| transpose |
|           |
+----|------+
     |
     | tensor2
     |
     v
```

Note that the `ethousu_init()` API of the Ethos-U driver need to be called at
startup, before calling the TFLM API. More info in the [Ethos-U driver repo](https://gitlab.arm.com/artificial-intelligence/ethos-u/ethos-u-core-driver).

For even more info regarding Vela and Ethos-U, checkout [Ethos-U landing page](https://gitlab.arm.com/artificial-intelligence/ethos-u/ethos-u/-/tree/main).

# Some examples of compiling a binary and running a network with Ethos-U support.
In order to run a test with Ethos-U55 enabled, a platform with corresponding
hardware support is required. One such platform is the fixed virtual platform
(FVP) based on Arm Corstone-300 software. See [Corstone-300 readme](https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro/tree/main/tensorflow/lite/micro/cortex_m_corstone_300/README.md)
for more info.

On top of that the .tflite model needs to be modified according subchapter
"Ethos-U custom operator" above.

The log level of the Ethos-U driver can be set in the build command. For
example: ETHOSU_LOG_SEVERITY=ETHOSU_LOG_INFO.

## Example using network tester
See tensorflow/lite/micro/examples/network_tester/README.md for more info.

```
make -f tensorflow/lite/micro/tools/make/Makefile network_tester_test CO_PROCESSOR=ethos_u ETHOSU_ARCH=u55 TARGET=cortex_m_generic TARGET_ARCH=cortex-m55 microlite
```

For the Arm Corstone-300 target, ETHOSU_ARCH is defined in
cortex_m_corstone_300_makefile.inc so it doesn't need to be defined on the
command line.

```
make -f tensorflow/lite/micro/tools/make/Makefile network_tester_test CO_PROCESSOR=ethos_u TARGET=cortex_m_corstone_300 TARGET_ARCH=cortex-m55 test_network_tester_test NETWORK_MODEL=path/to/network_model.h INPUT_DATA=path/to/input_data.h OUTPUT_DATA=path/to/expected_output_data.h

make -f tensorflow/lite/micro/tools/make/Makefile network_tester_test CO_PROCESSOR=ethos_u TARGET=cortex_m_corstone_300 TARGET_ARCH=cortex-m55 test_network_tester_test
```
